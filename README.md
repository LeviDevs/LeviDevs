## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I own [Paragon Games](https://github.com/paragongames), an organization backing a work-in-progress Minecraft PvP/mini-game server.

Creator of [LunarClientSpoofer](https://github.com/LeviDevs/LunarClientSpoofer), the only mod that makes servers think you're using [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) on Forge.

Fluent in JVM (Java, Kotlin), MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and other tools.\
Familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Python and some other languages.\
My current interests are reverse engineering certain software, like bot/cheat prevention.
